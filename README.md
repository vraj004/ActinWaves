# ActinWaves
A Model of Actin Polymerization Waves

This is a collaborative project between University of Melbourne and Vanderbilt University to develop mechanistic insights into cell motility. This model is a finite element implementation of the interaction between actin polymerisation and mechanical forces in cells on planar surfaces. The model is based on a study by Holmes et al: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22785332
